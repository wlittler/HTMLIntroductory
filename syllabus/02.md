# Instruction Plan 

### Semantic elements

Elements that clearly describe its meaning to both the browser and the developer. One of the benefits of writing HTML semantically is that it's easy-to-use. The use of HTML elements gives the developer the possibility of writing fewer attributes and avoiding inline styles. All of this makes your code less clumsy. If some developer has to read or edit your code, they will have an easy interaction with it since they won't waste time on trying to figure out how it works. Plus, your code will be condensed, thereby making the file load faster.

Example of a web page not using semantic element

```html
<div id="main">
    <div id="section">
        <div id="article"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="aside"></div>
</div>
<div id="footer">
</div>
```
Example of a web page using semantic elements

```html
<main>
    <section>
        <article></article>
    </section>
    <aside></aside>
</main>
<footer>
</footer>
```
### Other benefits

Many of us only consume the web through the web browser, but there is a portion of the world that does not. Many use screen readers, monochrome screens, need to print the page, or another accommodation. In those cases it not so much how the content is presented but how it is structured. Imagine a website without having CSS styling and know that the page is still understood by other computer program consuming the HTML page. 

```html
<p>Lorem <b>ipsum</b> dolor sit <i>amet.</i></p>
```
```html
<p>Lorem <strong>ipsum</strong> dolor sit <em>amet.</em></p>
```

### Hands-on 

There was a miscommunication in our team, the developer that was working on the HTML part of the project created a website not using semantic elements, but the designer that worked on the CSS file did work using semantic type selectors. Now the website doesn't look the way it should. Please help us out!

### Homework 

You've been hired to build the landing page for the Daily Planet newspaper. You will be working alongside with a designer that **already** worked on the CSS. As requirements all you need to do is to make sure you have the following elements on your page:

* header
* nav
* main
* section
* article
* aside
* footer

The designer told me that the web page structure is the following

    <tr>
        <th>Area</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
