# Instruction Plan




Have you noticed even though you add no CSS to your webpage things comes with a default style. The `user agent` is providing styles to elements and sometimes is good but sometimes we want to have a maximum control over elements and how we are modifying them. There is pretty cool set of CSS rules used for many developer that will help us to gain that control.

### Google Font

You have noticed that we don't have many options when it comes to select a font, we pretty much have the [CSS Web Safe Font](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp) for us to work with and to be honest it is very limited. We can increase the possiblity of fonts used on a webpage using Google Fonts. Just visit [Google font](https://www.google.com/fonts) website and check all the available font they have in the library.

Once you have added to the collection the font you want to use, click on the `use` button at the bottom of the page to choose the style you want

![Add to Collection](../images/08/google-font.gif)

> Dont go over yellow or red on the `Page Load-meter`. If you are adding too many styles there is something wrong with the design of the website.

Now, go down to step 3 and copy the link given to you.

![Copy link](../images/08/google-fonts-link.gif)

That link you just copied goes on your HTML page. It needs to go before the CSS file is going to utilize that font.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Awesome website</title>
        <!-- Font from Google Fonts -->
        <link rel='stylesheet' href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,300,700'>
        <!-- CSS file that is going to utiliza that font -->
        <link rel='stylesheet' href='css/my-style.css'>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- HTML Elements-->
    </body>
</html>
```

This is how you'd implement that font on your CSS file

```css

/* my-style.css */

body {
    font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
}

h3 {
    font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
    font-weight: 700;
}
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Awesome website</title>
        <!-- Remove some style given by the user agent -->
        <link rel='stylesheet' href='css/css-reset.css'>
        <!-- CSS file that contains your style -->
        <link rel='stylesheet' href='css/my-style.css'>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- HTML Elements-->
    </body>
</html>
```

### Evaluate

During class let's build together a webpage. We need to put together some elements

* Folder for CSS and images files - provided by this [initial project](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/HTMLIntroductory/raw/master/archives/08/archives/exercise/evaluation.zip)
* Add Open Sans as the default font from Google Fonts
* Add CSS reset to the project

This is what we are going to build together in class - if times allows.

### Homework

Finish the last two parts of the webpage by next class. You can continue working from your project or you can use the [homework file](https://github.com/AustinCodingAcademy/HTMLIntroductory/raw/master/archives/08/homework/winery.zip) and start working from there.
